The guess_number function starts by generating a random number between 0 and 100, which the user needs to guess. The game prompts the user to guess the number and provides feedback based on whether the guess is correct or not.
The game loop continues until the user correctly guesses the number. The loop also increments a counter variable to keep track of the number of attempts. If the user guesses the correct number, the program prints a congratulatory message along with the number of moves it took to guess correctly.
If the user's guess is incorrect, the program provides hints to guide the user toward the correct answer, either suggesting a bigger or smaller number.

The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number, and the final result is displayed.
